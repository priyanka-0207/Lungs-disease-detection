The models detects various lungs disease and visualizes the possibility of a disease using a grad-cam visualizer
# Lung Disease Detection Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the detection and classification of lung diseases using medical imaging data or clinical data. The primary goal is to assist healthcare professionals by developing a predictive model that accurately diagnoses lung conditions such as pneumonia, tuberculosis, lung cancer, or COVID-19 from chest X-rays or CT scans.

## Problem Statement
Lung diseases cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Early and accurate detection can lead to timely treatment and improve patient outcomes. This project uses machine learning and/or deep learning techniques to automate lung disease diagnosis, helping to reduce diagnostic errors and speed up decision-making.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Download and organize medical images and labels.
   - Handle class imbalance if present.

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Image resizing, normalization, and augmentation.
   - Split data into training, validation, and test sets.

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Visualize sample images and label distribution.
   - Basic statistics on dataset size and classes.

4. **Model Development**
   - Train deep learning models (e.g., CNN architectures like ResNet, VGG, DenseNet).
   - Tune hyperparameters for best performance.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC.
   - Analyze confusion matrix and error cases.

6. **Deployment (Optional)**
   - Export the trained model.
   - Build a simple web app or API for inference.

## Technologies & Tools
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras or PyTorch
- OpenCV, PIL for image processing
- Jupyter Notebook for prototyping
- scikit-learn for metrics and data handling
- Flask/FastAPI (optional) for deployment
